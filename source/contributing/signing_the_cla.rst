Note to External Contributors
-----------------------------

Hello, External Person!

We at cclpbx are eager to work with you. 

In particular, in order for us to accept any patches from you, you will have to
electronically sign a statement that indicates two things:

* You are willingly licensing your contributions under the terms of
  the open source license of the project that you’re contributing to.

* You are legally able to license your contributions as stated.

The reason we do this is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we don’t “taint”
the projects we manage with contributions that turn out to be improper. This protects
everyone who wants to use the projects, including *you*! If you want a longer explanation,
then you can check out the [CLA Rationale page](https://github.com/fusionpbx/opensource/blob/master/cla-rationale.md).

Once you sign the Contributor License Agreement (the “CLA”), we will then be able to
merge your contributions with a clear conscience and with only the friction that results
from the usual technical back-and-forth of a vibrant open source project.

To get started with this process, visit the
[Sign the CLA](https://github.com/fusionpbx/opensource/blob/master/sign-cla.md)
page.


Thanks, cclpbx!
